In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of
the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
secret number.

next . main game loop

::::About::::
game is that you have a string of 3 digits [numeric] and you now have to guess it 
you may or may not have more than 10 chances
game return 
-----> fermi -----> one digit is correct and at correct place.
-----> pico -----> one correct digit in wrong place.
-----> bagels-----> no correct digits 

::::::::::::psuedocode::::::::::::
1.num generator
constraints:
randomly [1234567890]  generated 3 digit long string

----->randomly [1234567890] range m se uthao aur 3 digit long string generate 
----->yeah that's it.
2.checker:
constraints:
-----> fermi -----> one digit is correct and at correct place.
-----> pico -----> one correct digit in wrong place.
-----> bagels-----> no correct digits 
-loop through the inputted list and check if you have the correct answer
-append fermi if you have one correct one and then check next.
